## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS v4.1](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)


### What I learned

How you must take care of the spaces, padding and gaps when working with responsive designs, ussualy if you have both an space and a gap at the same time, you may find unexpected behaviors on your webiste.

Also, learned how using the mobile-first workflow help us to apply responsivity in our website.

### Continued development

I want to improve my abilities when working with the new CSS unit line-height [lh] as currently I am not sure of when to use it.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to understand better the behind of the classNames of tailwind and how to apply them better.
- [Traversy Media - React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDB4uaJ87e0) - This is an amazing video from Traversy Media that really help me get to the cores concepts on React. Very recommended.
